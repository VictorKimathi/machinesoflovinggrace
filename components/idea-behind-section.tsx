                In 1967, poet Richard Brautigan envisioned a world where technology and nature existed in perfect
                harmony. His poem "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace" imagined a cybernetic meadow where
                computers and humans coexisted with mutual respect and care.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Today, as we stand at the threshold of an AI revolution, Brautigan's vision feels more relevant than
                ever. We have the opportunity to build machines that don't just serve us, but truly care for usâ€”and for
                our planet.

                "I like to think of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature,
                returned to our mammal brothers and sisters..."
